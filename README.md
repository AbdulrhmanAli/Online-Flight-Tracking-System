# Online-Flight-Tracking-System

# 1. Introduction:

The travelers of flights donâ€™t have exact information about the flight timing,
therefore, you are required to design and implement a system using which the users
through computer or smartphone get the information about flight timings and if the
flight is on time and not. Also the system should allow the users to web-check in if
the user has no check in luggage and only hand carry. The flights live information
can be procured form more than 2 sources viz., the airport authority server and
online free sources such as adware flight, to ensure the accuracy of the information
based on which users can plan their travel.
